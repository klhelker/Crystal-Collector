# Crystal Collector
jQuery game
This game lets the player click on crystals in order to win.  
A random number is given at the beginning of the page.  Below this number is the number that is added when clicking on each crystal.  If the added number below the random number given equals out, then the player wins.  If the player goes over the random number given, the player losses.  

The player gets started on the game by clicking on a crystal. 
The game will automatically reset once there is a win or loss. 
The wins and losses will be visually displayed to the player.
